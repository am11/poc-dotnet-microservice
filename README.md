# poc-dotnet-microservice
This is only proof of concept of dotnet core microservices. In this POC I used docker containers, consul, ASP.NET, RabbitMq.


Running example:

in docker toolbox type
./startContainerHeaven.sh

This will start 3 consul server run in separate docker containers. RabbitMq server running in docker container.
